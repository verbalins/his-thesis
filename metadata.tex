\thesissummary{As society is rapidly changed by electrification, digitalization, and globalization, the automotive industry is particularly affected. Reacting to these changes requires predictive tools, the most common being Discrete-Event Simulation combined with Multi-Objective Optimization, referred to as Simulation-Based Optimization. Production lines are most often the focus for optimization while the factory level is ignored even though the factory level has a larger impact on the total production. One reason for not optimizing on the factory level is the time needed due to the complexity of the line models making up the factory model. This licentiate thesis aims to validate and evaluate a model simplification technique to enable optimization of factories leading to cost and resource effective manufacturing.}
